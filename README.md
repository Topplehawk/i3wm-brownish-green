im using cava for the audio visualiser and peaclock for the clock

the status bar is polybar

the terminal is kitty

im using Vivialdi for the browser

the neovim theme is availbe at https://github.com/projekt0n/caret.nvim

the background can be found at https://www.pexels.com/photo/view-of-a-forest-in-autumn-19855952/
I do NOT hold the rights to the background.

to use this theme you will need vim-plug this can be found at https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug?tab=MIT-1-ov-file

the cava and peaclock should automaticaly assign thier colors to fit with those of the terminal. you might want to chnage the bar width and hight and spacing in cava though

to use the config files just copy config file into the applicable direcotry found under .config
make sure to remove the old .config file after doing this. do not do this by deleting it. for safty's sake make sure to put it into a separate folder just incase something goes wrong.
